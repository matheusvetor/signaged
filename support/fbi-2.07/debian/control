Description: transform digital camera jpeg images
 exiftran is a command line utility to transform digital image jpeg
 images. It can do lossless rotations like jpegtran, but unlike
 jpegtran it cares about the EXIF data: It can rotate images
 automatically by checking the exif orientation tag, it updates the
 exif informaton if needed (image dimension, orientation), it also
 rotates the exif thumbnail. It can process multiple images at once.
