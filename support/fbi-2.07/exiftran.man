.SH NAME
exiftran - transform digital camera jpeg images
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B exiftran [ options ] file(s)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B exiftran
is a command line utility to transform digital image jpeg images.  It
can do lossless rotations like jpegtran, but unlike jpegtran it cares
about the EXIF data: It can rotate images automatically by checking
the exif orientation tag, it updates the exif informaton if needed
(image dimension, orientation), it also rotates the exif thumbnail.
It can process multiple images at once.
.SH TRANSFORM OPTIONS
.TP
.B -a
automatic (using exif orientation tag)
.TP
.B -9
rotate by 90 degrees clockwise
.TP
.B -1
rotate by 180 degrees clockwise
.TP
.B -2
rotate by 270 degrees clockwise
.TP
.B -f
flip vertical
.TP
.B -F
flip horizontal
.TP
.B -t
transpose
.TP
.B -T
transverse
.TP
.B -nt
Don't rotate exif thumbnail.
.TP
.B -ni
Don't rotate jpeg image. You might need this or or the -nt option to
fixup things in case you rotated the image with some utility which
ignores the exif thumbnail. Just generating a new thumbnail with -g is
another way to fix it.
.TP
.B -no
Don't update the orientation tag.  By default exiftran sets the
orientation to "1" (no transformation needed) to avoid other
exif-aware applications try to rotate the already-rotated image
again.
.SH OTHER OPTIONS
.TP
.B -h
print a short help text
.TP
.B -d
Dump exif data for the file(s).
.TP
.B -c <text>
Set jpeg comment tag to <text>.
.TP
.B -g
(re)generate EXIF thumbnail.
.TP
.B -o <file>
Specify output file.  Only one input file is allowed in this mode.
.TP
.B -i
Enable inplace editing of the images.  Exiftran allows multiple input
files then.  You must specify either this option or a output file with
-o for all operations which modify the image (i.e. everything but -d
right now).
.TP
.B -b
Create a backup file when doing inplace editing.
.TP
.B -p
Preserve timestamps (atime + mtime) when doing inplace editing.
.SH EXAMPLES
Autorotate all jpeg files in the current directory:
.nf
   exiftran -ai *.jpeg
.fi
